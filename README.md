# ParkEasy
ParkEasy is an automated parking system which is based on the ANPR algorithm.

ParkEasy proposes an automated and reliable solution to the above-mentioned issue. This 
system takes away all the human interference in logging entries and offers a cost effective and 
smart solution for managing a completely un-manned parking lot.
This approach is based on Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology which 
performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on images to read the license plates on 
vehicles. The license plate of a vehicle is first detected from a live video stream of a webcam. 
Then the license plate is recognized using the OCR algorithm to determine the alphanumeric 
characters on the plate. This license plate number is then stored in the database with the entry 
time of the vehicle. Customers are charged as per the parking time when the vehicle leaves the 
building. The payment is completely automated and convenient for the customer.
This solution also offers an interactive and easy solution to the time-consuming traditional 
parking system that is, dynamic pricing. This system calculates the price for each customer in 
real time based on the time spent by their vehicle in the parking lot. The price amount is 
automatically deducted from the customers local e-wallet. Thus, the payment process is 
completely hassle free for the customer.

The log reports of complete entry and exit data is sent to the client-side processing unit which 
in turn will offload the data in real time to the central database server. All this data can be easily 
and safely accessed using a locally hosted web page which offers a rights-based login terminal.
